**MkNodes** offers a node representing a complete basic default website template called [MkDefaultWebsite][mknodes.MkDefaultWebsite].
By passing keyword arguments defined in the config, it is also possible to inject some
static pages. That way it is possible to construct a basic website for small projects without
much effort. The injected pages can even be remote. As an example, we will construct a small
website for MkDocs.

The following config...

{{ config | MkCode(language="yaml") }}

Combined with this CLI call...

{{"mknodes build" | MkCode(language="terminal")}}


Will create this website:


{{ "https://phil65.github.io/mkdocs_mknodes/mkdocs" | MkLink(as_button=True, icon="web") }}
