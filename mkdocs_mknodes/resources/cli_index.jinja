**MkNodes** offers a CLI interface in order to build projects based on
Callables. The CLI is closely aligned to the **MkDocs** CLI to simplify the usage. Most
arguments have the same name. Right now the CLI is mostly useful for testing purposes, but features
will get extended in the future.

The CLI is based on `Typer` and uses a `rich` based handler for nice, colored output.


There are 3 diffent commands right now:

- `mknodes build`: Similar to `mkdocs build`, but with the option to point
to a (remote) repository as well as a Website template in form of a Python Callable to build

- `mknodes serve`: Same as `mknodes build`, but for serving the page.

- `mknodes create-config`: Does a test run with given callable and repository and
creates a Config file based on the metadata and extension requirements provided
by the combination of Callable and repository.
