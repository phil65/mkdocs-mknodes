## Overview

**MkDocs-MkNodes** integrates the **MkNodes** toolkit into **MkDocs**.


**MkNodes** is a library to create complex documentation websites. It includes a powerful jinja environment to assist in writing Markdown text as well as a a large set of so-called **MkNodes**, which can be used to create re-usable node trees describing a complete website. That node tree covers the whole site navigation, down to single Markdown elements, allowing the creator anytime to switch between programatically creating documentation and writing Markdown "by hand".

This plugin acts as a bridge: It embeds **MkNodes** into the **MkDocs** event hook system and converts the **MkNodes** tree to a **MkDocs**-powered website.

    Still sounds confusing? The best way to learn how everything works is to start with the [MkNodes](https://phil65.github.io/mknodes) documentation. This website will focus on the integration with **MkDocs**.

    In addition, all pages on this website include an Admonition box at the bottom, which also includes the code which generated the page. That might be a helpful resource to understand how **MkNodes** can be used.


## Hello, world

A minimum example for a **MkNodes** website:

``` py
def build(project: mk.Project):
    index_page = project.root.get_index_page(hide="toc")
    index += mk.MkAdmonition("Hello world!")
```

Additional features:
- Rewrite MkDocs-Material templates on-the-fly to add additional functionality
- An upgraded MkDocs CLI with nicer output and additional functionality
